# Daily Programmer Solutions
I'm throwing up all my daily programmer solutions here

Most of them are finished, but there are some unfinished 'drafts' thrown up. These have been authored over the last 2 years as I've been programming, so some are more polished than others :)

Currently, there are solutions in 5 languages:
 * C#
 * JavaScript
 * Ruby
 * Python
 * ActionScript 3

Note: These solutions often try to be somewhat clever at the expense of readability, in the vein of Daily Programmer.
