# Daily Programmer Solutions
I'm throwing up all my daily programmer solutions here

Some of them are finished, and some of them are just rough drafts. Some of them are ugly, some of them aren't.

The earlier one's are kind of ugly

Currently, there are solutions in 5 languages:
 * C#
 * JavaScript
 * Ruby
 * Python
 * ActionScript 3
