# Daily Programmer Solutions
These are any of the challenges I've finished/attempted

Most of them are finished, but there are some unfinished 'drafts' thrown up. These have been authored over the last 2 years as I've been programming, so some are more polished than others :)

Currently, there are solutions in 5 languages:
 * C#
 * JavaScript
 * Ruby
 * Python
 * ActionScript 3
 * Go

Note: These solutions often try to be somewhat clever at the expense of readability, in the vein of Daily Programmer.
